If you have different size filters, you need to modify `processBuffer(buff_in)` to account for that. The filters for `demod` are generated in the `__init__` function of the `TNCaprs` class.

The difference is that we will load data in small buffers of 1024 samples and process them over a larger buffer made of several small buffers.  There are two points to make here. First: the idea is that no matter what size of buffers you use, the result of the overlap and save should be the same. If it isn't, then you have a bug.... and believe us... we had many before we got it right. Second: Generally, there are some overheads associated with operating on different sized buffers. The performances will vary with different architectures and memory.  We will look at several sizes and measure the time to process about 9 million samples (3.4 min at 44.1 kHz).\n",

See the [standard](http://www.aprs.org/doc/APRS101.PDF) page 95 for more details. The extra information in a 3rd Party Header takes up 20 or more bytes in the info field of an AX.25 packet, reducing the maximum number of bytes we can safely transmit in a single packet. However, the APRS-IS servers and, most importantly, direwolf are able to handle longer packets which break the standard for safety when dealing with unusual character encodings. We can take advantage of that fact for the purpose of this project to avoid truncating the data in each packet even more than we already have to. \n",
